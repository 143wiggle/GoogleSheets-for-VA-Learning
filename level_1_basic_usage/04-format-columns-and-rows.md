[Task 4: Format Columns and Rows]

Goal
Learn how to adjust column width, row height, and apply basic formatting (bold, borders, colors) — an essential VA skill to keep sheets clean, readable, and client-friendly.

Steps to Practice
Open Google Sheets and create or open a spreadsheet.

Select a column or row header (e.g., A, B, 1, 2).

Right-click and choose “Resize column” or “Resize row” to adjust manually or fit to data.

Highlight cells and apply Bold, Fill color, or Borders from the toolbar.

Use the toolbar to adjust text size or font style for headers and categories.

Try using alternating row colors for cleaner layout (Format > Alternating colors).
